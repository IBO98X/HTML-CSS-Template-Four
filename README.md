# Simple HTML & CSS template

This is my 4th simple template made with CSS &amp; HTML only and i created this template from Osama Elzero courses so anyone want to learn from him you can click here it will open his youtube channel: [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo).

This time, the 4th template focused on creating a custom framework, which gave me a clearer understanding of how real frameworks like Bootstrap work. And This Time Unlike the previous templates that had only one HTML page, this one included multiple pages, so it took more time to completeâ€”but I really liked it.

At the end i hope you like the design.
